## Take the first steps to improve your time management skills

This app allows users to keep track of their daily activities in 20-minutes increments in order to improve their time-management skills. The clear presentation of the distribution of the activities entered (either the most recent week or a selected date) allows users to better understand how they're spending their day so they can become more productive and also have more free time.
